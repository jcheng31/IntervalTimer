# IntervalTimer
A basic timer for the .NET Micro Framework.

`IntervalTimer` takes in two durations - one short, one long - and triggers events when each expire in an alternating fashion: short-long-short-long etc.

(This project hasn't yet been run or tested. It's just a quick hack for something I might do in the future.)
